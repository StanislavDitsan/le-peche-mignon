                It all started back in late 2006. After many scooter runs around
                London looking at sites the stars aligned, and we found our spot
                on Ronalds Rd. We fell in love with the neighbourhood on first
                sight and not much has changed since!
                <br />
                <br />
                We&apos;re open every day from 7:30 to 4pm and we hope we have
                every base covered. Pop in for a morning coffee (or takeaway if
                you&apos;re against the clock), leisurely breakfast at the
                weekend or stock up on store cupboard essentials â€” we hope we
                live up to our name!
                <br />
                <br />
                (Did you work it out?) We have since branched out and opened our
                second site in Bishop&apos;s Stortford in Hertfordshire in 2023.
